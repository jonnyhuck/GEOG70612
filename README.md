# GEOG70612/1: GIS and the Web
Some of the code associated with very old versionms of my GEOG70612/1 'GIS and the Web' course (circa 2015).

This is only here for the benefit of the students that have taken the course, and is unlikely to be of much use to others (*though feel free to take a look, of course*).
